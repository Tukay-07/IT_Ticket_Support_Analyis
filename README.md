## ðŸ”Ž Project Overview
In this challenge, I assumed the role of an **IT Analyst** and analysed **support ticket data (12,000 tickets)** to uncover operational insights and identify improvement opportunities.  

The focus areas included:  
- Ticket volumes & resolution times  
- SLA performance  
- Queue efficiency  
- Regional & tag-based patterns  
- Opportunities for automation  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Tickets:** 12,000  
- **Rows Analyzed:** 11,924  
- **Tickets per Day:** 23  
- **Support Queues:** 10+ (avg. 1,200 per queue)  
- **Period:** Rolling daily support activity  
- **Regions:** Multiple (e.g., Belgium, Sweden)  

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Metrics
- **SLA Target:** 4 days (max acceptable resolution time)  
- **Average Resolution Time:** 2.8 days  
- **Days Saved:** 1.2 days vs SLA  
- **SLA Compliance:** 100%  
- **Total Tickets:** 12,000  
- **Tickets per Day:** 23  
- **Average per Queue:** 1,200  

---

## âœ… Key Insights
- **IT Queue Volume** â†’ 17.4% of daily activity (~2,000 tickets), consistently high.  
- **Technical Support Load** â†’ 28.4% of tickets (3,412), busiest queue overall.  
- **Top Tag â€“ "Technical"** â†’ Used on 25.5% of tickets, highlighting recurring issues.  
- **Resolution Times** â†’ Avg. 2.8 days, within SLA (4 days).  
- **Priority Handling** â†’ High-priority tickets resolved in 2 days with 100% SLA compliance.  
- **Ticket Types** â†’ Requests & Changes (2.9 days) close slightly slower than Incidents (2.7 days, 39% of all cases).  
- **Regional Consistency** â†’ Belgium & Sweden show similar IT Incident patterns, enabling standardised strategies.  
- **Low-Volume Queues** â†’ Teams like Ad, Strategy, Cybersecurity take longer despite fewer tickets.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways
- **Technical Support & IT** are the most resource-intensive queues â†’ should be prioritized.  
- **Resolution practices** are effective, and SLA compliance is strong.  
- **Recurring tags** (Technical, Security, Feedback) â†’ great automation/self-service opportunities.  
- **Global consistency** â†’ Stable operations across regions.  
- **Process inefficiencies** â†’ Small, low-volume queues are underperforming.  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations
- **Develop Self-Service Tools** â†’ FAQs, auto-responses, chatbots for IT & Technical tickets.  
- **Support Technical Queue** â†’ Add automation or staffing to maintain SLA under high volume.  
- **Content Creation** â†’ Build help centre articles for recurring tags ("Technical", "Security", "Feedback").  
- **Leverage Best Practices** â†’ Use Belgium & Sweden patterns to replicate success in other regions.  
- **Audit Low-Volume Queues** â†’ Improve triaging, ownership, and documentation for Ad, Strategy, Cybersecurity, etc.  

---

## âœ… Conclusion
The analysis shows that IT and Technical Support dominate ticket volume and require efficiency improvements. Current SLA performance is excellent, but recurring technical issues and underperforming small queues highlight opportunities for **automation, self-service, and workflow optimisation**.  

This positions the support team to scale effectively while maintaining high service quality.
